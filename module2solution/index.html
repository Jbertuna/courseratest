		  <p> Pizza is the pie of the world. My favourite pizza is meatlovers with pineapple. Unfortunately in my city there aren't any good pizza places so I have to make it by hand! I can talk about pizza for hours with anyone if they are willing. What is your opinion with pineapple on pizza?</p>

			<span id="Burger"> Burger </span>
			<p> Just like with pizza's, outside of McDonalds there are no good burger restaurants so I am doing my best to make my own! My favourite burger includes double beef, double cheese, and super crisy bacon. Fried chicken burgers are also amazing.

			<p> Now dessert is something my city does well, many many cafes and cake stores with heaps of options. Now if only I made enough money to enjoy these sweet treats!
